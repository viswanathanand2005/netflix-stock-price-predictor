# Netflix Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the stock price of Netflix (`$NFLX`). LSTMs are well-suited for time-series forecasting because they can remember patterns over long sequences of data.

The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on historical stock data from the `NFLX.csv` file.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used is `NFLX.csv`, which contains historical daily stock market data for Netflix Inc. It includes features such as:
* **Date**
* **Open**
* **High**
* **Low**
* **Close**
* **Volume**

## ðŸ§  Model Performance

The model was trained for 25 epochs. The training and validation loss curves show that the model generalizes well to the unseen data and does not exhibit signs of overfitting.
